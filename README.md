# Credit Card Customer Segmentation Using Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction: Unsupervised Machine Learning

The objective of this report is to develop a customer segmentation of active credit card users for a certain bank in order to define an efficient marketing strategy. THis project is an example of unsupervised machine learning which aims to segment the data into different clusters from which we can develop effective marketing campaigns based on the various features that reflect customer behavior. The dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 credit card holders within a period of six months. The dataset is extracted from Kaggle. 

We use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimenionality of our dataset. After that, we experiment clustering the data with KMeans and Agglomerative clustering. Then, we choose KMeans as our model and develop marketing strategies for each cluster.

Check out the report for full analysis.
